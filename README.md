AS3935 Franklin Lightning Sensor™ IC by AMS

The AS3935 works by detecting radio frequency emissions generated by lightning activity, and uses algorithms to distinguish these from man-made “disturbers” and to calculate the energy from strikes. From which it's able to then estimate the distance to the head of the storm over a 1–40km range.

* draws only 60uA in listening mode
* will issue an interrupt when lightning is detected
* can be interfaced using I2C or SPI
